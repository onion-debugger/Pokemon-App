# Pokemon-App


Using the api provided on https://pokeapi.co/ to build an application that shows a list of all the pokemon characters and their pictures with a nice looking UI. 

When a pokemon character is clicked it leads to a page with full details of the character pulled from the appropriate endpoint with all images, move, abilities, stats etc showing at different sections.
